## Sentiment Analysis of NBA Fans

### Abstract
This project investigates the sentiment of NBA fans through the analysis of social media data. Fans of sports teams are incredibly passionate, and their emotions can swing many times throughout a game, especially during a season. Each NBA subreddit has between 20,000 and 141,000 subscribers, so these forums are places where many fans are voicing their opinions. By collecting a dataset of fan content, this project aims to quantify the sentiments and trends in the aspects of the NBA. This project explores how sentiments vary across teams, and how it compares the sentiment to results and other statistics in the league. The findings show insights into the landscape of the NBA, and if the reactions of the fans are accurate. Passion from the fans can lead to more tickets and merch sales, which can lead to positive outcomes of the franchise, so this information could be key for front offices.
